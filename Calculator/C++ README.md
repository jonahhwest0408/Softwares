# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

The program I have written is a simple command-line calculator that demonstrates various features of the C++ language. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program makes use of several important concepts and features of C++ including classes, inheritance, virtual functions, the Standard Template Library (STL), and dynamic memory management. 

The primary purpose of writing this calculator software is to demonstrate and solidify my understanding of various fundamental and advanced concepts in the C++ programming language. This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to create a practical and functional application.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools and environments used to make this program are VS Code, Notepad, and the Command Line Terminal.

The calculator software is written in C++, a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in systems programming, game development, real-time simulations, and performance-critical applications. The library I used was the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL is a powerful library that provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms, such as vectors, maps, lists, and more. It enhances productivity by offering ready-to-use components.

# Future Work

- Ensure proper deletion of dynamically allocated memory by using smart pointers (std::unique_ptr) instead of raw pointers to avoid memory leaks and simplify memory management.
- Enhance the division by zero check to prevent any potential undefined behavior.
- Enhance the console interface to be more user-friendly, possibly by adding clear instructions and improving the layout of prompts and messages.
