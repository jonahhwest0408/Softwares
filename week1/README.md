# Overview

The software is a Python script designed to output the phrase "Hello world" to the console. It serves as a basic example of a "Hello, World!" program, which is commonly used as a starting point for learning a new programming language or demonstrating the syntax of a language. The script consists of a single line of code that utilizes the print() function to display the specified message.

One of the most common uses of a "Hello, World!" program is to introduce beginners to programming concepts and syntax. It's often the first program a novice programmer writes when learning a new language. By executing this program, beginners can see the basic structure of a program and understand how to produce output in the chosen language.

# Development Environment

The tools required to make a simple print("Hello world") statement in Python are a code editor such as VS Code or Linux, a Python extension if needed to code in that language, and hopefully a good working desktop or laptop.

Python is a general-purpose programming language, meaning it can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more. Its versatility makes it popular among developers across various domains.
