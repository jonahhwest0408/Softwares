# Overview

The software I developed is an expense tracker implemented in Java. It demonstrates various features of the Java language, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and data structures from the Java Collection Framework.

The purpose of writing this software is to create a tool that facilitates the tracking of personal or business finances. By developing an expense tracker in Java, the intention is to provide a convenient and efficient means for users to monitor their expenses over time.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software are as follows: 
- Notepad Text Editor
- Command Line Terminal
- Java Complier (javac)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

I used the Java programming language to develop the expense tracker software. Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence, robustness, and versatility.
I made extensive use of standard Java classes and interfaces, such as Scanner for input handling, ArrayList for managing collections of expenses, and File, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter for file I/O operations.
